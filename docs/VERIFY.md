# Verifying Mochlet by hand

Everything below has a scripted counterpart (`scripts/test.sh`, `scripts/test-hook.sh`,
the `mochlet://debug/…` channel in debug builds). This is the list to walk through on a real
machine before a release.

## Character and notch (M1–M3)

- Launch: the slime drops into the notch, greets, collapses after a moment.
- Hover: it looks at the pointer. Click: ask bubble. Double-click: quick menu. Triple-click: meeting
  note-taker (later milestone). Five clicks: it splits and pulls itself back together. Hold: push-to-talk.
- Drag it out of the notch to any corner; drag it back. "Let me out" / "Back to the notch" in the menu.
- Idle CPU in Activity Monitor: about 1–2 % compact, under 0.5 % hidden (`scripts/measure-idle.sh`).

## Agent observation (M4)

1. Settings → Agents → Claude Code → Install…: the preview shows the whole new `~/.claude/settings.json`;
   the existing `statusLine` command is kept inside the relay chain. Confirm; a `.bak-…` appears next to it.
2. In iTerm: `claude -p "echo hi"`. A mini slime pinches off, the ticker shows the project, the final line
   appears, the slime does its happy jump, the mini merges back about six seconds after the turn.
3. Interactive `claude`, ask it to run a shell command: the approval card appears in the notch; Allow runs it,
   Deny stops it, "Reply in terminal" hands the prompt back; pressing Esc in the terminal removes the card
   with "Handled in iTerm."
4. Ask Claude a question that triggers AskUserQuestion (for example "ask me which colour I prefer with the
   AskUserQuestion tool"): the question card appears; pick a chip; the answer reaches the terminal.
5. `/plan` → ExitPlanMode: the plan card offers Auto mode / Manual / Change plan.
6. Open two sessions in two iTerm tabs; `⌃⌥T` selects the tab of the focused session (the one whose mini
   you clicked last). tmux panes are selected first when the session lives in tmux.
7. Codex: Settings → Agents → Codex → Install…, then `/hooks` inside `codex` and trust; `codex exec "say hi"`
   shows a Codex mini (◎). The Codex plan pill shows the week usage (needs `codex app-server`).
8. Gemini: install, then `gemini -p "hi"` shows a Gemini mini (✦).
9. The Claude plan pill appears after the first statusline refresh; both pills can be hidden in Settings → Agents.
10. Remove the hooks: the settings file goes back to the previous content, including the old statusLine.

Scripted version of 2–5 without any agent:

```sh
scripts/build-app.sh debug && open build/debug/Mochlet.app
T="token=$(cat ~/Library/Logs/Mochlet/debug/token)"
scripts/replay-hooks.sh Tests/Fixtures/hooks/claude-session.jsonl 0.4
scripts/replay-hooks.sh Tests/Fixtures/hooks/approval.json 0 &      # then on the card, or:
open "mochlet://debug/approve?decision=always&$T"
scripts/replay-hooks.sh Tests/Fixtures/hooks/question.json 0 --ask &
open "mochlet://debug/answer?pick=SQLite%20FTS5&$T"
open "mochlet://debug/shot?name=card&$T"                             # ~/Library/Logs/Mochlet/debug/card.png
```
